    <h3>Mark Gebhardt, FMP</h3>
    <h4>Student Personnel Supervisor</h4>
    <h5>phone: 970-351-3802</h5>
    
    <p>I am starting my 15th year here at UNC! I have a Masters in Higher Educational Leadership from UNC and a double BA in Restaurant and Hotel Management from another Metropolitan  State College in Denver. Iâ€™ve been working here long enough that my own kids are starting to attend UNC, on their path to becoming UNC graduates.</p>
    <p>
        
        My perfect fit is at Holmes Dining Hall working with the students -- both as employees and as guests. My role here is to help you -- the student -- graduate from college with classroom knowledge PLUS life skills gained from working with others.
    </p>
    <p>        
        We have a diverse staff here at Holmes, with 30+ international students from over 13 different countries. We also have around 120 students from all over the United States. Together we provide an exceptional dining experience for our customers. Our employees have the opportunity to gain leadership and organizational skills, as well as life long connections to your fellow students.
    </p>

    <p>I look forward to meeting you when you visit Holmes Dining Hall!</p>
